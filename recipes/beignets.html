    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>7 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup shortening</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>¼ cup confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Dissolve yeast in warm water. Pour into a large bowl and stir in evaporated milk, white sugar, eggs, and salt. Add 4 cups flour and beat until smooth.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Mix in shortening. Mix in remaining 3 cups flour. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Roll dough out on floured surface to 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 2 1/2-inch squares.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Heat oil in a deep pot to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Fry beignets in batches until browned and puffed. (If beignets sink and do not pop up, oil is not hot enough.) Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Shake confectioners' sugar over hot beignets. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
